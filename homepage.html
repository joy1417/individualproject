            "Joy was extremely professional and helpful in helping us find the perfect apartment to rent in the downtown core. He worked hard to find us the perfect place that was within our set budget and even provided other alternatives that he knew we would be interested in. He was patient and very flexible working with us, which made the whole process much less stressful! I would highly recommend Conrad to anyone looking to buy or rent as he treats all of his clients with the utmost respect. Thanks Joy!"

        <p>
            "We were a couple new to Toronto and found it hard to find accommodation when we arrived. After meeting Conrad, he showed us several properties in various locations relevant to our budget and within 2 weeks we had moved into a condo that we love for its location and amenities. Conrad is very genuine but most of all efficient and always felt he took the time with us until we found exactly what we were looking for. I would definitely recommend him to anyone who is thinking of buying/selling or renting."
